I’ve worked closely with the developers to enhance the Kubernetes deployment, working on docker images, and developing their CI/CD pipeline allowing to build/test and the helm chart responsible for the application deployment within the cluster on EKS.\n\nI have implemented multiple features such as logging, monitoring, kubernetes security (role-based service accounts), besides helping my colleagues in day-by-day implementations. I’ve developed the installation script which the company planned to use to deploy the application into the customer’s AWS account, I’ve been involved into each choice regarding the user experience, enforcing best practices and planning each integration carefully to get a reliable, professional deployment while keeping it as simple as possible to deploy and maintain. Such script was a terraform wrapper, like terragrunt, focused on user experience, error management, and logging for remote troubleshooting. Unfortunately, even though the idea was good, the company eventually closed in December 2021.",

The challenge was to trick the authentication system into thinking the script was a human and get the cookie to fetch the data looking up for HTML tables and records. Fetched data allowed me to present deadlines automatically and in real time, formatting conveniently the output, elaborate historical data and automate processes like sending an extract on a spreadsheet when required (spreadsheets were written natively in Perl) or share working status directly on a webpage. The software is still in use at Microfocus, the company who acquired Autonomy’s Digital Safe.",

I've spent the first 5 years at San Paolo IMI bank, giving support to the customer on site. I've moved from that role as a senior sysadmin, and started working into infrastructure management and then design thorugh the years. My last two clients, AdR (Aeroporti di Roma) and Ministero delle politiche agricole alimentari e forestali (MiPAAF), have been the most important, where I had to design and manage the whole infrastructure - and deal with the customer's needs - by myself. Since there was not much more I could learn about on-premise deployments, I've eventually decided to move to the UK and start learning about cloud infrastructures, which was also giving me the chance to use more Linux.",
